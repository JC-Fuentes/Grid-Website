        The Pokemon listed on this page are my top favorite legendaries from all the generations.
    </article>

    <div>
        Articuno:
    </div>

    <div>
        From generation I, Articuno is a legendary bird Pokémon that can control ice. The flapping of its wings chills the air. As a result, it is said that when this Pokémon flies, snow will fall.
    </div>

    <div>
        Lugia:
    </div>

    <div>
        From generation II, Lugia's wings pack devastating power—a light fluttering of its wings can blow apart regular houses. As a result, this Pokémon chooses to live out of sight deep under the sea.
    </div>

    <div>
        Raikou:
    </div>

    <div>
        Also from generation II, Raikou embodies the speed of lightning. The roars of this Pokémon send shock waves shuddering through the air and shake the ground as if lightning bolts had come crashing down.
    </div>

    <div>
        Rayquaza:
    </div>

    <div>
        From generation III, Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years. Legends remain of how it put to rest the clash between Kyogre and Groudon.
    </div>

    <div>
        Darkrai:
    </div>

    <div>
        From generation IV, It chases people and Pokémon from its territory by causing them to experience deep, nightmarish slumbers.
    </div>
